Four functional metagenomic studies were considered1√ê4, that analysed human faecal samples, sewage, latrines and soils.
The sequences of the inserts were downloaded according the access numbers provided in the publications using BatchEntrez.

Processing of the inserts
The inserts were annotated with PROKKA5 in order to distinct putative ARDs from other genes present in the insert. Then, only ARDs selected on antibiotics towards which they are assumed to confer resistance have been selected (e.g. a Tet(M) variant found on an insert selected on amoxicillin was not considered further).
For more than one ARD on the contigs: the ARD which was assumed to confer resistance to the antibiotic in the medium was kept. If both could confer resistance to the antibiotic, they were not considered.
Eventually, as some partial genes were found, only ARDs with at least the median amino acid size of ARDs from the same ARD family were kept (260aa for beta-lactamases, 178aa for Cat, 378aa for Tet_efflux, 641aa for Tet_protection, 247aa for 16S rRNA methlytransferases and 158aa for Dfr.

The different ARD families are:
16S_rRNA_methyltransferase: 16S rRNA methyltransferase for aminoglycoside resistance
AAC: aminoglycosides acetyl-transferases
ANT: aminoglycosides nucleotidyl-transferases
APH: aminoglycosides phospho-transferases
beta_lactamase: beta-lactamases (all sub-families)
cat: chloramphenicol acetyl-transferases
dfr: dihydrofolate reductase
efflux_pump: efflux pumps
qnr: quinolone resistance
tet_efflux: spanning Tet(A) and variants
tet_protection: spanning Tet(M) and variants
tetX: tetracycline monooxygenases
van_ligase: homologues of D-Ala-D-x ligases (selected on D-cycloserine)

The different antibiotics used for selection are:
AMK: amikacin
AMX: amoxycillin
ATM: aztreonam
CAR: carbenicillin
CAZ: ceftazidime
CDR: cefdinir
CHL: chloramphenicol
CIP: ciprofloxacin
CTX: cefotaxime
CYC: D-cycloserine
FEP: cefepime
FOX: cefoxitin
GEN: gentamicin
MIN: minocycline
OXY: oxytetracycline
PEN: penicillin
PIP: piperacillin
SIS: sisomycin
SXT: cotrimoxazole
TET: tetracycline
TGC: tigecycline
TMP: trimethoprim
TZP: piperacillin+tazobactam
